# Codewars excercises
The goal of this repo is to upload my solutions for the exercises I face on codewars!

# Technology used
For these challenges i'll use JavaScript.

# The challenge
* Stay consistent as much as I can.
* Improve my problem solving skills.
* Learn creative solutions and best practices.

# The drawback
Although it's a good way to learn by practice, it's often overlooked how someone can struggle when trying to solve these challenges.
In that way one must try to keep it cool and give its best at approaching difficult problems... because as a wise man says: it's a maraton, not a sprint.
