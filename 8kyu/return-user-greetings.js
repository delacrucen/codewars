// Problem
/*Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".*/

// Program
function greet(name){
  return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`
}

// Console testing
console.log(greet("Mauri"));

// Expected output
//"Hello, Mauri how are you doing today?"
